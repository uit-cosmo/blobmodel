    abstract = {Filamentary structures, also known as blobs, are a prominent feature of turbulence and transport at the edge of magnetically confined plasmas. They cause cross-field particle and energy transport and are, therefore, of interest in tokamak physics and, more generally, nuclear fusion research. Several experimental techniques have been developed to study their properties. Among these, measurements are routinely performed with stationary probes, passive imaging, and, in more recent years, Gas Puff Imaging (GPI). In this work, we present different analysis techniques developed and used on 2D data from the suite of GPI diagnostics in the Tokamak à Configuration Variable, featuring different temporal and spatial resolutions. Although specifically developed to be used on GPI data, these techniques can be employed to analyze 2D turbulence data presenting intermittent, coherent structures. We focus on size, velocity, and appearance frequency evaluation with, among other methods, conditional averaging sampling, individual structure tracking, and a recently developed machine learning algorithm. We describe in detail the implementation of these techniques, compare them against each other, and comment on the scenarios to which these techniques are best applied and on the requirements that the data must fulfill in order to yield meaningful results.},
