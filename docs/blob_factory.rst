Parameter Distributions
=======================

By default a realization obtained by an instance of ``Model`` will have degenerate distributions of all blob parameters. For any interesting application this is not enough.
In order to provide the highest possible flexibility for setting blob parameters this is done by a separate class, which
should implement ``BlobFactory``. An implementation is provided by ``DefaultBlobFactory`` which allows to easily set independent distributions of any blob parameters to a wide range of distribution families.

DefaultBlobFactory
++++++++++++++++++

We can use ``DefaultBlobFactory`` class in order to change the distribution functions of the following blob parameters:

* Amplitudes
* widths in x and y
* velocities in x and y
* pulse shape in x and y
* blob alignment and tilt

The distributions for these parameters are set with the ``*_dist`` arguments. The following distribution functions are implemented:

.. list-table:: 
   :widths: 10 50
   :header-rows: 0

   * - "exp"
     - exponential distribution with mean 1

   * - "gamma"
     - gamma distribution with ``free_parameter`` as shape parameter and mean 1

   * - "normal"
     - normal distribution with zero mean and ``free_parameter`` as scale parameter

   * - "uniform"
     - uniform distribution with mean 1 and ``free_parameter`` as width

   * - "ray"
     - Rayleight distribution with mean 1

   * - "deg"
     - degenerate distribution at ``free_parameter``

   * - "zeros"
     - array of zeros

As you can see, some of these distributions require an additional ``free_parameter`` to specify the distribution.
This is done by the ``*_parameter`` arguments.

Let's take a look at an example. Let's assume we want to sample the blob amplitudes from normal distribution with 5 as the scale parameter. 
We chose the defualt distributions for all other blob parameters. We would set up the Model as follows:


.. code-block:: python

  from blobmodel import Model, DefaultBlobFactory

  my_blob_factory = DefaultBlobFactory(A_dist=DistributionEnum.normal, A_parameter=5)

  bm = Model(
      Nx=200,
      Ny=100,
      Lx=10,
      Ly=10,
      dt=0.1,
      T=20,
      blob_shape=BlobShapeImpl(BlobShapeEnum.gaussian),
      blob_factory=my_blob_factory,
      t_drain=100,
      num_blobs=100,
  )

  ds = bm.make_realization()

CustomBlobFactory
+++++++++++++++++

But what if you want to use a distribution function that is not implemented? Or maybe you even want to change the initial position and arrival time of each blob?
In this case you can use the ``CustomBlobFactory`` class to define all blob parameters individually. An example could look like this:

.. code-block:: python

   from blobmodel import (
    Model,
    BlobFactory,
    Blob,
    AbstractBlobShape,
    )
    import numpy as np

    # create custom class that inherits from BlobFactory
    # here you can define your custom parameter distributions
    class CustomBlobFactory(BlobFactory):
        def __init__(self) -> None:
            pass

        def sample_blobs(
            self,
            Ly: float,
            T: float,
            num_blobs: int,
            blob_shape: AbstractBlobShape,
            t_drain: float,
        ) -> list[Blob]:

            # set custom parameter distributions
            amp = np.linspace(0.01, 1, num=num_blobs)
            width = np.linspace(0.01, 1, num=num_blobs)
            vx = np.linspace(0.01, 1, num=num_blobs)
            vy = np.linspace(0.01, 1, num=num_blobs)

            posx = np.zeros(num_blobs)
            posy = np.random.uniform(low=0.0, high=Ly, size=num_blobs)
            t_init = np.random.uniform(low=0, high=T, size=num_blobs)

            # sort blobs by _t_init
            t_init = np.sort(t_init)

            return [
                Blob(
                    blob_id=i,
                    blob_shape=blob_shape,
                    amplitude=amp[i],
                    width_prop=width[i],
                    width_perp=width[i],
                    v_x=vx[i],
                    v_y=vy[i],
                    pos_x=posx[i],
                    pos_y=posy[i],
                    t_init=t_init[i],
                    t_drain=t_drain,
                )
                for i in range(num_blobs)
            ]

        def is_one_dimensional(self) -> bool:
            return False


    bf = CustomBlobFactory()
    tmp = Model(
        Nx=100,
        Ny=100,
        Lx=2,
        Ly=2,
        dt=0.1,
        T=10,
        blob_shape=BlobShapeImpl(BlobShapeEnum.gaussian),
        t_drain=2,
        periodic_y=True,
        num_blobs=1000,
        blob_factory=bf,
    )

    ds = tmp.make_realization()

By assigning an array like to the variables ``amp``, ``width``, ``vx``, ``vy``, ``posx``, ``posy`` and ``t_init`` we can exactly define every single blob parameter of every single blob.

.. note::

   When using ``CustomBlobFactory`` it is your responsibility to make sure all blob variables have the correct dimensions. Also, if you wish to normalize the parameters you have to do this manually.
